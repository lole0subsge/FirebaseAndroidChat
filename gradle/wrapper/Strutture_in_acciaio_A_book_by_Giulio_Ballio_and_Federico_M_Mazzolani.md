# Strutture in acciaio: A book by Giulio Ballio and Federico M. Mazzolani
 
Strutture in acciaio (Structures in steel) is a book written by Giulio Ballio and Federico M. Mazzolani, two professors of civil engineering at the Politecnico di Milano, Italy. The book was first published in 1987 by Hoepli, and it covers the design and analysis of steel structures according to the European standards and limit states. The book has 780 pages and it is divided into 12 chapters, covering topics such as material properties, structural systems, connections, stability, seismic design, fire resistance, fatigue and corrosion[^1^]. The book is intended for students, engineers and researchers who are interested in steel structures.

Alternatively, a PDF version of the book can be downloaded for free from some websites[^2^] [^3^], but the quality and legality of these sources are not guaranteed. The authors have also published other books on steel structures, such as Progettare costruzioni in acciaio (Designing steel constructions) and Advanced Earthquake Engineering Analysis[^1^].

## Advanced Earthquake Engineering Analysis: A book edited by Alain Pecker
 
Advanced Earthquake Engineering Analysis is a book that presents the fundamentals of displacement-based methods for the design and analysis of structures subjected to seismic actions. The book was edited by Alain Pecker, a professor of civil engineering at Ecole Polytechnique, France, and published by Springer in 2007. The book is part of the series CISM International Centre for Mechanical Sciences, and it has 214 pages and 10 chapters[^1^].
 
The book covers topics such as soil behaviour under cyclic loading, soil-structure interaction, earthquake foundation design, nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures, pushover analysis, direct displacement-based design and assessment, design and assessment of bridges, and seismic testing. The book is based on lectures given by experts in the field of earthquake engineering at the International Centre for Mechanical Sciences (CISM) in Udine, Italy. The book is intended for researchers, engineers and students who want to learn more about the state of the art in earthquake engineering design and analysis[^1^] [^2^].
 
The book is available in English language only, and it can be purchased from Springer or other online bookstores. Alternatively, an eBook version of the book can be accessed from SpringerLink with a subscription or a one-time payment. The book has received 37 citations according to Google Scholar[^2^], and it has been reviewed by some journals such as Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics and Journal of Earthquake Engineering[^3^].

### Soil-Structure Interaction: A key factor in earthquake engineering
 
Soil-structure interaction (SSI) is the phenomenon that occurs when the soil and the structure built upon it influence each other's response to external forces, such as earthquakes. SSI is a complex and nonlinear process that depends on the characteristics of both the soil and the structure, such as their stiffness, damping, geometry, mass and boundary conditions. SSI can have significant effects on the seismic performance of structures, such as modifying their natural frequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes, displacements, forces and stresses.
 
SSI can be beneficial or detrimental for the seismic behaviour of structures, depending on the specific case. For example, SSI can reduce the seismic demand on structures by increasing their effective damping and reducing their effective stiffness, resulting in lower accelerations and forces. On the other hand, SSI can also increase the seismic demand on structures by amplifying the ground motion at certain frequencies or inducing resonance effects. Moreover, SSI can cause differential settlements and rotations of foundations, which can lead to structural damage or collapse.
 
Therefore, it is important to account for SSI in the seismic design and analysis of structures, especially for those with large or flexible foundations, such as bridges, nuclear power plants, dams and tall buildings. SSI can be evaluated by using different methods, such as analytical solutions, numerical models or experimental tests. However, each method has its own advantages and limitations, and there is no single method that can capture all aspects of SSI accurately and efficiently. Therefore, a combination of methods is often used to obtain reliable and realistic results.
